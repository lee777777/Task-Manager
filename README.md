# Task-Manager
ESBAAR has launched a new internal software tool, called “Task Manager”. This tool will help ESBAAR employees track and manage their day-to-day tasks. To promote this tool internally, a website landing page highlighting its features and capabilities was designed.
I was challenged to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design (that was handed to me by ESBAAR) as possible.
I have used HTML, CSS and JS to complete this challenge and the Technologies I have used are:
1- Visual Code Studio as an code editer.
2- css framworks: bootstrap 5 and w3schools css.
3- javascrip framworks: bootstrap.
4- fontawesome icons.
5-Sass: CSS pre-processors .
How to install and run the project?
just download the repository using git clone command and use your local server of choic to run this website on your local machine browser.
